Honda, Nissan and Tesla are among the companies that raised wages for U.S. employees after the UAW deal.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The breakthrough also triggered a wave of UAW organizing, the union says. Over 10,000 non-union auto workers have signed cards in support of the UAW in recent months and organizing campaigns have broken out at more than two dozen facilities, the union <a class=\"zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE\" data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\" href=\"https://uaw.org/volkswagen-workers-in-chattanooga-will-vote-in-their-union-election-on-april-17-19/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a statement last month.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The election at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga offered a difficult test, even as the union appears poised for growth. The UAW suffered narrow defeats in two elections at the facility over the past decade.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Governors of six southern states, including Tennessee Gov.

Volkswagen is proud of our working environment in Chattanooga that provides some of the best paying jobs in the area,\" the company added</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">A union victory would help bolster the UAW's membership, which has dropped steadily from a peak of 1.5 million workers in 1970 to 370,000 last year.</p>, <p class=\"PFoxV eBpQD KMxLo GpQCA tuAKv zuqUq WTxSK HxnoC JmHQS KlMT BEWVm\" id=\"MOREWhyisTrumpsTruthbody\"></p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The opportunity for membership expansion at the UAW, just months after its high-profile strike against the Big 3, exemplifies a wider trend in the U.S. labor movement.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">More than 500,000 workers went out on strike nationwide in 2023, more than doubling the figure recorded a year earlier, according to <a class=\"zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE\" data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\" href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/faculty-and-research/labor-action-tracker/annual-report-2023#:~:text=2023%20Key%20Findings&amp;text=These%20470%20work%20stoppages%20resulted,%25%20(224%2C000%20to%20539%2C000).\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations</a>.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The uptick in activity, however, failed to translate into union membership gains.

The boy is being held in juvenile detention for threatening a student on a bus in another incident earlier this month, authorities said.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Brandon O'Quinn Rasberry, 32, was shot in the head in 2022 while he slept at an RV park in Nixon, Texas, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of San Antonio, investigators said. He had just moved in a few days before.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy's possible connection to the case was uncovered after sheriff's deputies were contacted on April 12 of this year about a student who threatened to assault and kill another student on a school bus. They learned the boy had made previous statements that he had killed someone two years ago. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy was taken to a child advocacy center, where he described for interviewers details of Rasberry's death “consistent with first-hand knowledge” of the crime, investigators said.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy said he had been visiting his grandfather, who lived a few lots away from Rasberry in the RV park. He described the 9 mm pistol and its “dirt and army green” color, and said he took it from the glove box of his grandfather's truck. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy described entering Rasberry's RV, shooting him in the head, and shooting again into the couch before leaving, then returning the gun to the truck, investigators said.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy told his interviewer he had seen Rasberry in the RV park earlier in the day, but never met him and had no reason to be mad at him. Rasberry's body was found after he failed to show up for work for two days.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy said his grandfather later sold the pistol. Deputies located it at a pawn shop. Shell casings from the previous crime scene were matched to the gun, investigators said.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The boy was placed in 72-hour emergency detention “because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child’s mental wellbeing,” the sheriff’s office said.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">He was brought to a psychiatric hospital in San Antonio for evaluation and treatment and then was taken back to Gonzales County.

The federal government has sued Idaho over the ban, contending it violates a federal law that requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care — including abortion — if a patient's life or health is at serious risk.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Idaho's attorneys say the ban allows for life-saving procedures for things like ectopic pregnancies, and they contend the Biden administration is trying to create a federal “abortion loophole” at Idaho hospitals. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case on Wednesday. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Idahoans United for Women and Families is fundraising and hopes to have one or more ballot initiatives ready to propose this summer in an effort to get them on the 2026 ballot, Folwell said. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Across the country, there have been increased efforts to put abortion rights questions to voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Voters in seven states have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures, and several other states have signature drives for future ballot initiatives underway. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Cynthia Dalsing, a certified nurse midwife in northern Idaho and a board member for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said her region went from offering a “premiere obstetric range of services” to becoming a maternal care desert after the four local obstetricians moved out of state. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Pregnant women in the state's panhandle now must either travel as much as 80 miles away or leave the state entirely for obstetric care, Dalsing said. Some are delivering babies at home because of a lack of other options, she said. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Roughly one-quarter of Idaho obstetricians have stopped practicing since a near-total abortion ban took effect in August 2022, along with about half of the state's maternal fetal medicine doctors, according to data compiled by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative. Three hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Some physicians and businesses are warning that the abortion bans carry other ripple effects as well. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">During a news conference on Thursday, Dr. Jim Souza said the reduced access to prenatal health care means some dangerous pregnancy conditions will be diagnosed later than normal. Souza, the chief physician executive at the Boise-based St. Luke's Health System, said that could lead to increased need for intensive medical treatment for newborns or expensive medical interventions for mothers that could have been avoided with better access to obstetric care. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN\">A coalition of groups including the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, Levi Strauss <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> Co., Yelp, Lyft and Match Group Inc. which runs dating apps like Tinder filed a friend-of-the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case contending that the abortion bans make it harder to recruit and retain workers and lead to increased time off of work for those who have to travel elsewhere for care. </p>]\n",

Jim Justice announced Friday that West Virginia will not face a clawback of $465 million in COVID-19 money from the U.S. Department of Education, alleviating concerns raised by state lawmakers during the final days of the legislative session in March.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The Republican governor said in a statement that federal officials approved the state's application for a waiver for the money, which was a portion of the more than a billion dollars in federal aid the state received to help support students during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">In order to receive the money, the state needed to keep funding education at the same or a higher level than before the pandemic. In other words, the federal money could supplement existing state investment in education but not replace it.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">For federal spending packages passed in 2020 and 2021, that meant a dollar-for-dollar match. For 2022 and 2023, the federal government examined the percentage of each state’s total budget being spent on education.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Those regulations were waived for West Virginia in 2022. As lawmakers worked to finish the state budget in March at the close of the session, the state had not been approved for a waiver for 2023.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">The question threw the state’s budget process into disarray and caused uncertainty in the days before the 60-day legislative session, with lawmakers saying they would pass a “skinny budget” and reconvene to address unfinished business in May, when the financial situation is clearer.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Justice said then that his office was negotiating with the federal government and that he expected a positive resolution, citing funds dedicated to school service and teacher pay raises each year since 2018 — when school employees went on strike over conditions in schools.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">On Friday, he praised the federal government's decision, and he said he was never concerned the waiver wouldn’t be approved.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">“This announcement came as no surprise and was never a real issue,” Justice said. </p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">He also said the state has dedicated money to building projects and putting teaching aides in classrooms to improve math and reading skills. The state said it spent $8,464 per K-12 pupil in 2024, compared with $7,510 during Justice’s first year as governor in 2017, according to documents submitted to the federal government.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">But because state spending increased overall — from $4.9 billion in 2017 to $6.2 billion in 2023 — the percentage marked for education decreased. The key metric eliciting pause from the federal government was an 8% decrease in the education piece of the budget pie — from 51% in 2017 to 43% last year.</p>, <p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN\">Justice said the state's investment in education speaks for itself: State leaders also approved $150 million for the state's School Building Authority in the state budget for the fiscal year starting in July. </p>]\n",
