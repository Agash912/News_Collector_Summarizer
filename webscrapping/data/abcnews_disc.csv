0,USC cancels all commencement speakers after canceled valedictorian speech ,"Amid the decision to cancel this year's valedictorian speech, the University of Southern California announced it would be eliminating all outside speakers and honorees from its main-stage commencement taking place next month.In a memo released on Friday, the university said, ""To keep the focus on our graduates, we are redesigning the commencement program. Given the highly publicized circumstances surrounding our main-stage commencement program, university leadership has decided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees from attending this year's ceremony.""Scheduled keynote speakers included USC alumnus filmmaker Jon M. Chu, director of ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Wicked."" Sports icon Billie Jean King was also scheduled to speak.Asna Tabassum, a first-generation South Asian-American Muslim, was scheduled to give a commencement speech on May 10. School administrators, however, decided to cancel her speech citing safety concerns.USC said the decision was based on potential threats regarding the selection of the valedictorian.""After careful consideration, we have decided that our student valedictorian will not deliver a speech at commencement,"" provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs at USC, Andrew T. Guzman, said in a letter to students on Monday. ""While this is disappointing, tradition must give way to safety.""The college senior spoke about the situation with ABC News Live's Phil Lipof on Wednesday.""The valedictorian honor is ultimately a unifying honor, right? It's emblematic of USC's unifying values. And I think I take that to heart.""""I wanted my speech to be in the genre of a valedictory speech, and so that being said, I wanted to impart a message of hope. I also wanted to impart a message of responsibility,"" Tabassum said to Lipof.USC -- which expects a crowd of 65,000 for the commencement festivities on May 10 -- said the focus of the ceremony should be ""on the tremendous accomplishments of our 19,000-plus graduates, their friends, their families, and the staff and faculty who have been such a critical part of their journeys."""
1,"Volkswagen workers in Tennessee have voted to join UAW, union says ","In a seismic union election Friday evening, Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to join the United Auto Workers Union.The workers voted 2,628 to 985 for union representation, according to a spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board.""There were seven challenged ballots that won’t be counted, because they aren’t determinative to the outcome of the election. There were three void ballots. The total number of eligible voters was 4,326,"" according to a statement from the NLRB.The employer will begin ""bargaining in good faith"" with the union, with parties having five days to file objections to the election.The vote to unionize has the potential to supercharge organizing in the nation's auto sector and demonstrate the strength of a resurgent labor movement through a victory in the South, a region typically resistant to unions.Workers began casting ballots this week in the most significant test for the UAW since a strike last fall against the Big 3 U.S. carmakers that delivered substantial gains and a burst of interest from employees at non-union firms.""Workers in America are fed up with being left behind and unions are the path to dignity on and off the job,"" UAW president Shawn Fain said in February in a post on X, after having met with workers at the Volkswagen facility.The labor agreements at the Big 3 last year prompted some non-union competitors to offer pay increases and other benefits, putting their employees in closer alignment with UAW members. Honda, Nissan and Tesla are among the companies that raised wages for U.S. employees after the UAW deal.The breakthrough also triggered a wave of UAW organizing, the union says. Over 10,000 non-union auto workers have signed cards in support of the UAW in recent months and organizing campaigns have broken out at more than two dozen facilities, the union said in a statement last month.The election at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga offered a difficult test, even as the union appears poised for growth. The UAW suffered narrow defeats in two elections at the facility over the past decade.Governors of six southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, issued a joint statement this week criticizing the UAW and voicing general opposition toward unions.""As Governors, we have a responsibility to our constituents to speak up when we see special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by,"" they wrote.For its part, Volkswagen has remained publicly neutral toward the union drive. In a statement, the company told ABC News that it supports the union election process.""We respect our workers' right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests,"" Volkswagen said.""We fully support an NLRB vote so every team member has a chance to a secret ballot vote on this important decision. Volkswagen is proud of our working environment in Chattanooga that provides some of the best paying jobs in the area,"" the company addedA union victory would help bolster the UAW's membership, which has dropped steadily from a peak of 1.5 million workers in 1970 to 370,000 last year.The opportunity for membership expansion at the UAW, just months after its high-profile strike against the Big 3, exemplifies a wider trend in the U.S. labor movement.More than 500,000 workers went out on strike nationwide in 2023, more than doubling the figure recorded a year earlier, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.The uptick in activity, however, failed to translate into union membership gains. Only 10% of U.S. workers belonged to unions last year, little changed from the year prior, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.The election in Chattanooga will test whether the headline-grabbing labor strikes can translate into a resurgence of union growth, said Stephen Silvia, a professor at American University and the author of ""The UAW's Southern Gamble.""""Historically, unionization has proceeded in waves,"" Silvia said. ""Is this a wave? That's what we'll see."""
2,New York AG asks court to reject Trump's $175M bond for civil judgment,"Lawyers for the New York Attorney General asked Judge Arthur Engoron on Friday to reject former President Donald Trump's $175 million bond for his civil judgment and require him to post a new one within seven days.Letitia James contended that the former president failed to demonstrate that Knight Specialty Insurance Company, the company behind his bond, had the resources to pay the bond if Trump's appeal failed.""Defendants and KSIC have failed to justify KSIC as the surety on this extraordinarily large undertaking for a number of reasons,"" James said in the filing.In February, Engoron determined that Trump and his co-defendants engaged in a decade-long scheme to inflate the former president's net worth to get better business deals and interest rates on loans.Trump was at risk of having his properties seized after he failed to obtain a bond for the $464 million judgment, but a New York Appellate Court reduced the amount of money Trump would need to post to $175 million.Trump and his co-defendants posted a $175 million bond on April 1.The attorney general's filing stated that Trump and the company failed to demonstrate the collateral of the bond beyond $175 million in cash in a Charles Schwab brokerage account. In the motion, James also raised concerns that KSIC uses affiliates in the Cayman Islands to reduce the liabilities shown on their books and allegedly violates federal laws.""(KSIC is) a small insurer that is not authorized to write business in New York and thus not regulated by the state’s insurance department, had never before written a surety bond in New York or in the prior two years in any other jurisdiction, and has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million,"" James said in the filing.Judge Engoron is scheduled to hold a hearing on this issue on Monday.Don Hankey, the chairman of Knight Insurance Group, declined to comment on the matter."
3,Man dies after setting himself on fire outside courthouse where Trump is on trial,"A man who set himself on fire in a park across the street from the New York City courthouse where former President Donald Trump is on trial has died.The man, Maxwell Azzarello, was badly burned and taken to a hospital in critical condition, officials said, but he later died from his injuries.Trump was inside the downtown Manhattan courthouse at the time and was made aware of the fire outside, sources told ABC News.The NYPD said there were no threats to public safety but the NYPD Bomb Squad was sweeping the area out of an abundance of caution.Azzarello took pamphlets out of his backpack and threw them around the park before pulling out a canister, pouring a liquid on himself and lighting himself on fire, Jeffrey Maddrey, NYPD's chief of department, said at a news conference.He eventually fell to the ground and civilians, police and court officers ran into the park to try to extinguish the blaze, Maddrey said.""He doused himself and threw these pamphlets across the park ... and immediately just lit himself on fire,"" one witness told ABC News.The witness said the flames ""were just massive immediately.""""Pretty horrific thing to see,"" he said.The pamphlets appeared to be ""propaganda-based,"" officials said.Officials described Azzarello as a ""conspiracy theorist.""Azzarello is from St. Augustine, Florida, and arrived in New York earlier in the week, officials said. It appears he acted alone, officials said.""We’re very concerned,"" Maddrey said. He said the NYPD will review security protocol because of the ""gravity of the event going on,"" referring to the Trump trial.Trump is facing felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. It marks the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been tried on criminal charges.The trial began on Monday with jury selection. The full jury panel was selected by midday Friday.Opening statements will take place Monday.If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for free, confidential emotional support 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
4,5 teens injured in shooting at senior skip day gathering in Maryland park: Police,"Five teenagers were injured after gunfire rang out at a large gathering of high school students taking part in a senior skip day in Maryland, police said.Officers from several law enforcement agencies were responding to help control a crowd of 500 to 600 students who had gathered in Schrom Hills Park in Greenbelt Friday afternoon when they heard multiple shots ring out, according to Greenbelt Police Chief Richard Bowers.Five male victims ranging between the ages of 16 and 18 were located with gunshot wounds, Bowers said. All five victims were transported to local hospitals. One is in critical condition and the other four are stable, Bowers said.A suspect in the shooting is believed to have fled the park when the crowd dispersed following the gunfire and has not been located at this time, Bowers said. Police believe there was only one shooter, he said.The police chief called the shooting a ""horrible, tragic, senseless act.""""These were kids on senior skip day who were looking to have a good time in a local park, and to have something like this occur is just maddening,"" Bowers said.The students had initially gathered in Bowie, Maryland, for senior skip day and were asked to disperse by local law enforcement, a Greenbelt Police Department spokesperson told ABC News. Many of those students then moved to Schrom Hills Park, where they participated in a large water gun fight prior to the shooting, police said.Greenbelt Mayor Emmett Jordan said the gathering was ""informally organized"" on social media.""We don't condone skipping school, but it's the senior skip day,"" Bowers said. ""It's just a tragedy.""Students from multiple high schools in the area are believed to have been at the park, the chief said.A motive remains unclear.The shooting remains under investigation. Bowers urged anyone with footage from the incident to reach out to police. Investigators will also be looking over body-worn camera footage, he said.""We know that the person involved is definitely on a camera somewhere,"" Bowers said."
5,"10-year-old boy confesses to fatally shooting a man in his sleep 2 years ago, Texas authorities say","AUSTIN, Texas -- A 10-year-old boy has confessed to an unsolved killing in Texas, telling investigators that he shot a man he did not know while the victim slept, authorities said Friday. The boy, who was just shy of his eighth birthday when the man was shot two years ago, has been evaluated at a psychiatric hospital but cannot be charged with the crime because of his age at the time, the Gonzales County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Texas law requires a child to be at least 10 years old to have criminal culpability. The boy is being held in juvenile detention for threatening a student on a bus in another incident earlier this month, authorities said.Brandon O'Quinn Rasberry, 32, was shot in the head in 2022 while he slept at an RV park in Nixon, Texas, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of San Antonio, investigators said. He had just moved in a few days before.The boy's possible connection to the case was uncovered after sheriff's deputies were contacted on April 12 of this year about a student who threatened to assault and kill another student on a school bus. They learned the boy had made previous statements that he had killed someone two years ago. The boy was taken to a child advocacy center, where he described for interviewers details of Rasberry's death “consistent with first-hand knowledge” of the crime, investigators said.The boy said he had been visiting his grandfather, who lived a few lots away from Rasberry in the RV park. He described the 9 mm pistol and its “dirt and army green” color, and said he took it from the glove box of his grandfather's truck. The boy described entering Rasberry's RV, shooting him in the head, and shooting again into the couch before leaving, then returning the gun to the truck, investigators said.The boy told his interviewer he had seen Rasberry in the RV park earlier in the day, but never met him and had no reason to be mad at him. Rasberry's body was found after he failed to show up for work for two days.The boy said his grandfather later sold the pistol. Deputies located it at a pawn shop. Shell casings from the previous crime scene were matched to the gun, investigators said.The boy was placed in 72-hour emergency detention “because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child’s mental wellbeing,” the sheriff’s office said.He was brought to a psychiatric hospital in San Antonio for evaluation and treatment and then was taken back to Gonzales County. He was placed in juvenile detention on a charge of making a terroristic threat for the school bus incident. It was not immediately clear if the boy's family has an attorney. The Associated Press left a telephone message seeking comment at the office of Gonzales County Attorney Paul Watkins."
6,An Alabama prison warden is arrested on drug charges,"ATHENS, Ala. -- The warden of an Alabama prison was arrested Friday on drug charges, officials with the state prison system confirmed. Chadwick Crabtree, the warden at Limestone Correctional Facility, was charged with the manufacturing of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a statement from the prison system. Court records show that manufacturing charge accuses him of growing psilocybin mushrooms, a hallucinogenic.Court records did not show if Crabtree has an attorney to comment on his behalf. The Alabama Department of Corrections said its law enforcement division, along with a state SWAT team and the Limestone County sheriff's office, executed search and arrest warrants at Crabtree's home. Crabtree and his wife were both taken into custody.The prison system did not immediately disclose what led to the search, but said the investigation is ongoing. A search was also conducted at Crabtree’s office at Limestone, the prison system said. Crabtree has been placed on mandatory leave without pay pending further personnel action."
7,North Korea says it tested 'super-large' cruise missile warhead and new anti-aircraft missile,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Saturday it tested a “super-large” cruise missile warhead and a new anti-aircraft missile in a western coastal area as it expands military capabilities in the face of deepening tensions with the United States and South Korea.North Korean state media said the country’s missile administration on Friday conducted a “power test” for the warhead designed for the Hwasal-1 Ra-3 strategic cruise missile and a test-launch of the Pyoljji-1-2 anti-aircraft missile. It said the tests attained an unspecified “certain goal.”Photos released by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency showed at least two missiles being fired off launcher trucks at a runway.North Korea conducted a similar set of tests Feb. 2, but at the time did not specify the names of the cruise missile or the anti-aircraft missile, indicating it was possibly seeing technological progress after testing the same system over weeks.KCNA insisted Friday’s tests were part of the North’s regular military development activities and had nothing to do with the “surrounding situation.”Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest in years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un dialing up his weapons demonstrations, which have included more powerful missiles aimed at the U.S. mainland and U.S. targets in the Pacific. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by expanding their combined military training and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.Cruise missiles are among a growing collection of North Korean weapons designed to overwhelm regional missile defenses. They supplement the North’s vast lineup of ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at the continental United States. Analysts say anti-aircraft missile technology is an area where North Korea could benefit from its deepening military cooperation with Russia, as the two countries align in the face of their separate, intensifying confrontations with the U.S. The United States and South Korea have accused North Korea of providing artillery shells and other equipment to Russia to help extend its warfighting in Ukraine."
8,Idaho group says it is exploring a ballot initiative for abortion rights and reproductive care,"BOISE, Idaho -- A new Idaho organization says it will ask voters to restore abortion access and other reproductive health care rights in the state after lawmakers let a second legislative session end without modifying strict abortion bans that have been blamed for a recent exodus of health care providers. “We have not been able to get a fix from our lawmakers, our politicians. We are going to seek a fix from our people,” Melanie Folwell, a spokeswoman for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said Friday morning. “The people in Idaho understand the contours of this problem.”Idaho has several anti-abortion laws on the books, including one that makes performing abortions a crime even in medical emergencies unless they are done to save the life of the pregnant patient. The federal government has sued Idaho over the ban, contending it violates a federal law that requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care — including abortion — if a patient's life or health is at serious risk.Idaho's attorneys say the ban allows for life-saving procedures for things like ectopic pregnancies, and they contend the Biden administration is trying to create a federal “abortion loophole” at Idaho hospitals. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case on Wednesday. Idahoans United for Women and Families is fundraising and hopes to have one or more ballot initiatives ready to propose this summer in an effort to get them on the 2026 ballot, Folwell said. Across the country, there have been increased efforts to put abortion rights questions to voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and removed the nationwide right to abortion. Voters in seven states have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures, and several other states have signature drives for future ballot initiatives underway. Cynthia Dalsing, a certified nurse midwife in northern Idaho and a board member for Idahoans United for Women and Families, said her region went from offering a “premiere obstetric range of services” to becoming a maternal care desert after the four local obstetricians moved out of state. Pregnant women in the state's panhandle now must either travel as much as 80 miles away or leave the state entirely for obstetric care, Dalsing said. Some are delivering babies at home because of a lack of other options, she said. Roughly one-quarter of Idaho obstetricians have stopped practicing since a near-total abortion ban took effect in August 2022, along with about half of the state's maternal fetal medicine doctors, according to data compiled by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative. Three hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units. Some physicians and businesses are warning that the abortion bans carry other ripple effects as well. During a news conference on Thursday, Dr. Jim Souza said the reduced access to prenatal health care means some dangerous pregnancy conditions will be diagnosed later than normal. Souza, the chief physician executive at the Boise-based St. Luke's Health System, said that could lead to increased need for intensive medical treatment for newborns or expensive medical interventions for mothers that could have been avoided with better access to obstetric care. A coalition of groups including the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, Levi Strauss & Co., Yelp, Lyft and Match Group Inc. which runs dating apps like Tinder filed a friend-of-the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case contending that the abortion bans make it harder to recruit and retain workers and lead to increased time off of work for those who have to travel elsewhere for care.

9,"West Virginia will not face $465M COVID education funds clawback after feds OK waiver, governor says","CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Gov. Jim Justice announced Friday that West Virginia will not face a clawback of $465 million in COVID-19 money from the U.S. Department of Education, alleviating concerns raised by state lawmakers during the final days of the legislative session in March.The Republican governor said in a statement that federal officials approved the state's application for a waiver for the money, which was a portion of the more than a billion dollars in federal aid the state received to help support students during the COVID-19 pandemic.In order to receive the money, the state needed to keep funding education at the same or a higher level than before the pandemic. In other words, the federal money could supplement existing state investment in education but not replace it.For federal spending packages passed in 2020 and 2021, that meant a dollar-for-dollar match. For 2022 and 2023, the federal government examined the percentage of each state’s total budget being spent on education.Those regulations were waived for West Virginia in 2022. As lawmakers worked to finish the state budget in March at the close of the session, the state had not been approved for a waiver for 2023.The question threw the state’s budget process into disarray and caused uncertainty in the days before the 60-day legislative session, with lawmakers saying they would pass a “skinny budget” and reconvene to address unfinished business in May, when the financial situation is clearer.Justice said then that his office was negotiating with the federal government and that he expected a positive resolution, citing funds dedicated to school service and teacher pay raises each year since 2018 — when school employees went on strike over conditions in schools.On Friday, he praised the federal government's decision, and he said he was never concerned the waiver wouldn’t be approved.“This announcement came as no surprise and was never a real issue,” Justice said. He also said the state has dedicated money to building projects and putting teaching aides in classrooms to improve math and reading skills. The state said it spent $8,464 per K-12 pupil in 2024, compared with $7,510 during Justice’s first year as governor in 2017, according to documents submitted to the federal government.But because state spending increased overall — from $4.9 billion in 2017 to $6.2 billion in 2023 — the percentage marked for education decreased. The key metric eliciting pause from the federal government was an 8% decrease in the education piece of the budget pie — from 51% in 2017 to 43% last year.Justice said the state's investment in education speaks for itself: State leaders also approved $150 million for the state's School Building Authority in the state budget for the fiscal year starting in July.

10,"House Democrats help Johnson avoid defeat on foreign aid bills, despite GOP defections","The House on Friday cleared a key procedural hurdle in passing foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, despite dozens of Republican defections, with Democrats helping Speaker Mike Johnson avoid a stinging defeat.Soon after, a third Republican said he would join a threatened move to oust him.The chamber voted 316-94 to advance the bills, setting up Saturday votes on final passage of $95 billion in foreign assistance that has been held up in a political fight in Washington for several months.Procedural votes such as Friday's are typically passed by the House majority alone, but Democrats stepped in to help push the legislation forward after Republican hard-liners collectively opposed the measure. More Democrats voted to advance the bills than Republicans.""Democrats, once again, will be the adults in the room,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during debate ahead of the vote.Leaving the House floor after the vote, Johnson said the four foreign aid bills are “the best possible product” under the circumstances. ""We look forward to final passage on the bill tomorrow.""The individual bills provide roughly $26 billion for Israel, $61 billion for Ukraine and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. The measures are similar to legislation passed by a bipartisan group in the Senate back in February, which tied all aid together into one measure.A fourth bill packaged into the foreign aid contains conservative priorities such as a TikTok ban bill, sanctions on Iran and legislation to seize Russian assets to help provide funding to Ukraine.“Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan are on the frontlines of the struggle to preserve democracy around the world,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., during debate. “In the case of Ukraine and Israel, these two nations are quite literally in harm’s way.”Pressure increased on lawmakers to pass aid after Iran's unprecedented attacks on Israel over the weekend.Johnson has forged ahead with the foreign aid measures, calling them pivotal, despite pushback from the right-flank of his party and looming threats to his job.A third House Republican, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, announced after Friday's vote his support for the motion to vacate the speaker's chair first introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene last month. In a statement, Gosar expressed frustration with moving ahead on aid to Ukraine rather than providing resources to the souther border.""We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,” Gosar said.Three Republicans supporting a motion to vacate would be enough to remove Johnson, unless Democrats decide to help defend the Republican speaker.On his way to the House floor for the vote, ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang asked Johnson if he was worried about possibly being ousted.“I don’t worry,"" Johnson responded. ""I just do my job.""But GOP hard-liners aired their frustrations with Johnson and his approach to this issue during debate.“I’m concerned that the speaker’s cut a deal with the Democrats to fund foreign wars rather than to secure a border,” Rep. Thomas Massie.Massie, R-Ky., earlier this week called on Johnson to resign and joined Greene's motion to vacate.Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, also took issue with ""another $100 million to fund war, unpaid for, with zero border security -- under a rule which Republicans should oppose because it is a process predesigned to achieve a desired predetermined outcome, with no border security.""""This was all precooked,"" Roy said. ""It's why President Biden and Chuck Schumer are praising it.""Democrats, meanwhile, criticized Republicans for bringing dysfunction to the chamber.""I would just say to my colleagues, 'Look at what MAGA extremism has gotten you: nothing. Nothing, not a damn thing,'"" Rep. McGovern said, who also told his colleagues,“You don’t get an award when you’re doing your damn job.”""We are in a divided government. Nobody is going to get everything they want,"" he added. ""I hope today's vote loosens the grip that MAGA extremism has on this body, and especially when it comes to supporting our allies.""Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, also a Democratic member of the House Rules Committee, also condemned the delay in getting aid passed: “Congress is finally going to vote ... Why did it take us this long?""The White House ahead of the vote released a statement of administration policy backing the bills, calling them ""long overdue"" and actions that would ""send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment."""

12,"Survivors of Columbine shooting discuss struggles with PTSD, anxiety","When 12 students and one teacher were gunned down in a mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999, the tragic event marked a turning point for America.Twenty five years later, some survivors recall how they have dealt with the physical and mental impact of PTSD, anxiety and depression.""It's a big part of my identity and who I am and not necessarily that day, but more who I've become,"" Heather Martin, a Columbine survivor, told ABC News Live. ""And a large part of that is because of the aftermath overcoming.""America endured school shootings before Columbine, but never one quite like the April 20, 1999, shooting.""We didn't have any context for a school shooting, couldn't name a school shooting,"" teacher Kiki Leyba a survivor, said.According to an ABC News review of the Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks all shootings in the United States, 415 people have been killed in school shootings since the Columbine attacks. As of April 2, 2024, 907 have been wounded.The Columbine High School shooting was one of the first instances where authorities brought in psychological experts to help the survivors cope with PTSD.It took 47 minutes for SWAT teams to enter the school after the shooting started. It took five hours for law enforcement to declare the school under control.""What we learned over the time was, certainly back then, you know, it was surround, wait for SWAT,"" Grant Whitus, one of the first SWAT officers to run inside Columbine High School, said. ""But later on, everybody was going in. So that's what we were teaching. You get in small group of people, we first started with for our you first forego immediately, then it cut down to one- and two-man's response to the active shooter. But no matter what, the first person was through that door, engage in the shooter. At least they made my bed. I'll take him out. But he can't be off shooting people when he's in a firefight with the cops.""The survivors of that day say they have suffered from trauma for 25 years, and the tragedy still haunts them.""That six weeks of therapy after it initially started, I received the insomnia diagnosis as well as the question of PTSD,"" Melissa Missy Mendo said. ""Somebody had asked my mom, you know, 'Why did you feel that Melissa was going to be, or that Missy was going to be different?' And she said 'I knew this: It was going to be different because she was 14 years old, sleeping with her shoes on in between her parents every night for weeks.'""As the years passed, the survivors of the shooting sought to connect with like-minded individuals who could understand their pain. In a snowball effect of grief and loss, the survivors of the Columbine shooting became the first modern iteration of mass shooting survivors. They found solace in their similarities in a group that only grew.The Columbine group connected with other mass shooting survivors, such as survivors from the Aurora movie theater shooting in 2012 and the Washington Navy Yard shooting in 2013.The group calls themselves The Rebels Project, a network of people who support one another across the country.""I feel fortunate to have a large survivor network from The Rebels Project because there were other moms in there that had gone through it,"" Mendo said. ""And they were like, when you start to talk to them about them, make sure that it's going to be age appropriate and make sure that it's situational. Because the story you want to give them at the beginning is going to be something that they can understand.""While the former students, now adults, are using unity to move forward, the teachers nearing retirement are handling their past experiences differently. Retired Columbine High School Principal Frank DeAngelis is embracing the lessons he learned from the tragic incident and using them to teach others.He is a safety and emergency management adviser for the school district and travels the world, sharing his 25 years of experience.""Every morning before my feet hit the ground, I recite the names of my beloved [students]: Cassie Bernell, Stephen Curnow, Corey DePooter, Kelly Fleming, Matt Kechter, Daniel Mauser, Danny Rohrbough, Dave Sanders, Rachel Scott, Isaiah Shoels, John Tomlin, and Lauren Townsend. They give me the inspiration to do what I'm doing right now,"" DeAngelis said. ""I'm going to continue doing it because I am not going to allow them to die in vain, along with all the other students and staff members who have lost their lives. And that's a promise that I can guarantee.""Before his retirement in 2014, DeAngelis said he had to check himself into the emergency room over 10 times because of anxiety attacks. He added that he was able to reduce the frequency of his attacks by consoling former students who faced similar problems.On April 20, 1999, the survivors who shared their experiences with ABC News described it as the worst day of their lives. However, 25 years later, they said some positive outcomes have emerged. One of them is the bond the survivors share with each other and the strength they derive from it. One survivor said some outstanding individuals are really tough, capable of enduring challenging situations and fighting through them."
13,"House to vote on foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel","The House of Representatives will vote Saturday on a series of bills to provide $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.After Democrats helped Speaker Mike Johnson avoid defeat and advance the legislation on Friday, lawmakers will consider amendments and hold debate on Saturday before voting on final passage.The long-stalled assistance would supply roughly $26 billion for Israel, $61 billion for Ukraine and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. A fourth bill being voted on Saturday includes measures to ban TikTok, sanction Iran and seize Russian assets to help fund Ukraine.The White House said it ""strongly supports"" the legislation, which is expected to pass with bipartisan backing from Democrats and Republicans. House Democrats plan to hold a closed-door caucus meeting ahead of votes Saturday at 12 p.m. EDT.But Johnson's push to get the aid across the finish line has angered some of his conference's far-right members, causing a growing threat to his speakership.A third Republican, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, announced Friday he was joining a looming motion to oust Johnson just after the aid bills advanced.Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the motion last month, accusing Johnson of “standing with the Democrats” after he worked across the aisle to avoid a government shutdown.After Johnson unveiled his plan to forge ahead on foreign aid, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky became the second hard-liner to back Greene’s cause. Massie called on Johnson to resign, a suggestion Johnson flatly rejected.All three lawmakers have expressed frustration on Johnson moving ahead with foreign aid without addressing immigration. Though earlier this year, a bipartisan border deal was produced by a group of senators but was quickly deemed dead on arrival by former President Donald Trump and Johnson.""Our border cannot be an afterthought,"" Gosar said in a statement. ""We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.""Johnson said Friday that the bills are ""not the perfect legislation"" but are “the best possible product” under the circumstances.It remains to be seen when, or if, the hard-liners force a vote on the motion to vacate the speaker's chair. If they do, Democrats would potentially need to step in to save Johnson's job.ABC News White House Correspondent MaryAlice Parks asked the administration if President Joe Biden discussed that possibility with Speaker Johnson in their phone call earlier this week.""We do not get involved when it comes to leadership in, whether it's the Senate or in the House,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded. ""We're very mindful. That is something that the members, in this case the members in Congress, have to decide on."""
