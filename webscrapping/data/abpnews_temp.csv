According to the Reuters report, the man identified as Maxwell Azzarello, 37, threw pamphlets into the air before dousing himself with a liquid from a can. A witness said that Azzarello burned for several minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azzarello lives in Florida and arrived in New York last week, as per a BBC report, he does not have a criminal background in New York and his family in Florida were unaware that he had travelled to the city. Speaking on Azzarello&amp;rsquo;s behaviour New York Police Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said he was &amp;ldquo;shuffling around&amp;rdquo; in the park close by before he reached into his bag to take out the flammable liquid and pamphlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Maddrey said the pamphlets were &amp;ldquo;propaganda-based&amp;rdquo; and on a &amp;ldquo;conspiracy theory&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN reporters said they saw a man engulfed in flames for more than three minutes. &quot;I see a totally charred human being,&quot; one of them said on air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A witness told BBC that it took her atleast 20 seconds to realise what had happened in front of her. &quot;It was hot, and it didn't make a lot of sense. The whole thing happened so fast... it took me like 20 seconds to figure out what was going on,&quot; she told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there was a massive police presence outside the courthouse the police ran towards him with a fire extinguisher to douse the flames. Azzarello was badly burned and was taken to the burn centre in a hospital, he is in a critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump&amp;rsquo;s Hush Money Payment Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred shortly after jury selection for Trump&amp;rsquo;s trial, now prosecutors and defence attorneys will make opening statements next week over the case regarding hush money paid to Stormy Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per Reuters, 12 jurors were selected, along with 6 alternates. The jury consists of seven men and five women, mostly employed in white-collar professions. This is the first trial to determine whether a former US president is guilty of breaking the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she alleged they had a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;"	https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/04/20/7b224aa37a51c7c289ec2ca9731c04d4171359885250019_original.jpg
India Delivers First Batch Of BrahMos Missile System To Philippines | ABP News	https://news.abplive.com/videos/news/world-india-delivers-first-batch-of-brahmos-missile-system-to-philippines-abp-news-1681339	Sat, 20 Apr 2024 11:31:38 +0530	&lt;p&gt;India has delivered its first batch of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and launchers to the Philippines as part of an important bilateral defence collaboration, two years after the USD 375 million deal was finalised in January 2022. The move reflects India's strategic aspirations to become a major player in defence exports. This was the first export order for the BrahMos missile.&amp;nbsp;The missiles and launchers departed from Nagpur late Thursday aboard an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, and the shipment reached Manila, the capital of the Philippines, April 19 morning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;	https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/04/20/f2a83fb2def88bed1b651cfd3dc58b611713592744012963_original.png
Middle East On Boil As Explosions Rock Iran-Backed Militia Base in Iraq, Tehran Warns Israel Of 'Immediate' Action — Top Points	https://news.abplive.com/news/world/iran-israel-conflict-tehran-warns-immediate-maximum-action-explosions-rock-militia-base-in-iraq-top-points-1681312	Sat, 20 Apr 2024 11:09:06 +0530	"&lt;p&gt;Tensions in the Middle East continue to simmer as five explosions on Saturday rocked a military base belonging to an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, killing three people, CNN reported. Although Israeli and US officials have ruled out their involvement in the blast, the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has warned that Iran would respond at an immediate and &quot;maximum level&quot; if Israel is found acting against its interests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what we know about the Iran-Israel Conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three people were wounded after five explosions hit an Iran-backed militia in Iraq at a site belonging to the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), CNN reported, citing Muhannad al-Anazi, a member of the Security Committee in Babylon Governorate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, there has been no information about the cause behind the explosions as Israeli and US officials have ruled out their involvement in the blast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The developments came a day after a military strike on Isfahan city, south of Tehran, on Friday. The attacks were reportedly said to have been carried out by Israel, but Iran downplayed the incident, indicating no plans for retaliation, Reuters reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the explosion, several flights were diverted over Iranian airspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As per media reports, Israeli officials stated that the alleged drone attack on Isfahan was meant to send a signal rather than causing damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has warned that Iran would respond at an immediate and &quot;maximum level&quot; if Israel is found acting against its interests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Amirabdollahian said that Iran was investigating the matter and added: &quot;It has not been proved to us that there is a connection between these and Israel.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD&quot; data-testid=&quot;paragraph-8&quot;&gt;While Israel made no official comment on the incident, U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__inherit-color__3208F text__inherit-font__1Y8w3 text__inherit-size__1DZJi link__link__3Ji6W link__underline_default__2prE_&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/blinken-says-us-not-involved-any-offensive-operations-when-asked-about-iran-2024-04-19/&quot; data-testid=&quot;Link&quot;&gt;Antony Blinken&lt;/a&gt; asserted that the United States had not been involved in any offensive operations. The White House, on the other hand, said it had no comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD&quot; data-testid=&quot;paragraph-8&quot;&gt;US on Friday imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel's far-right national security minister and two entities that raised money for Israeli men, who were accused of settler violence. In addition to the sanctions that have already been imposed on five settlers and two unauthorised outposts already this year, the fresh ones are the latest sign of growing US frustration with the policies of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iran, in a UN meeting on Thursday, justified its attack against Israel saying that it was a legitimate response to the suspected Israeli missile strike on its consulate compound in Damascus on April 1, which killed several Iranian officers including a top general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its response, Iran on April 13 launched its first ever direct attack on Israel. However, no casualties were caused as Israel shot down hundreds of the missiles and drones with the help of its allies, including the US.&lt;/li&gt;

Indian Man Jailed For 5 Years For Selling Drugs In US	https://news.abplive.com/news/world/indian-man-jailed-for-5-years-for-selling-drugs-in-us-1681290	Sat, 20 Apr 2024 09:49:05 +0530	"&lt;p&gt;An Indian man has been sentenced to five years in prison for selling controlled substances using the dark web, he was also ordered to forfeit about USD 150 million. According to PTI, Banmeet Singh, 40, who hails from Uttrakhand's Haldwani was arrested in London in April 2019 following the request by the United States, he was then extradited to the US in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances and conspiracy to commit money laundering in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole M Argentieri, the acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department&amp;rsquo;s Criminal Division at the time said, that the Justice Department will hold criminals who violate the US law accountable no matter how they conceal their activity, India Today reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Together with our international partners, we will continue to find criminals lurking in the darkness and bring their crimes to light&amp;rdquo;, Argentieri added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singh's Durg Operation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used dark web marketplaces, such as Silk Road, Alpha Bay, Hansa, and others to sell controlled substances, including fentanyl, LSD, ecstasy, Xanax, ketamine, and tramadol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was paid using cryptocurrency by his customers, and Singh would personally ship the drugs. He also arranged the shipment of the drugs from Europe to the US through mail or other shipping services. In order to ship to his customers, from mid-2012 to July 2017, Singh controlled at least eight distribution cells within the US including Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, North Dakota, and Washington, among other locations, the Department of Justice said on Friday in a press release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People responsible in these cells would re-package the drugs once they received them and send them to all 50 states in the US and, Canada, England, Ireland, Jamaica, Scotland, and the US Virgin Islands, the release said reports PTI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&amp;rsquo;s organisation moved hundreds of kilograms of controlled substances throughout the country and established a multimillion-dollar drug enterprise which laundered his drug proceeds from cryptocurrency accounts, which was ultimately worth approximately $150 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the release, the Justice Department&amp;rsquo;s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Singh from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;"	https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/04/20/ecc5e2fd26cbfc17fb90278967d2f0fd171358427758819_original.jpg

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese nationals were travelling in a van along with two security guards when two terrorists tried to attack the van, Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) DIG Asif Aijaz Shaikh told Dawn News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the terrorists' attempt, the security guards killed one of them while another terrorist blew himself up, attempting to come close to the van, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIG Shaikh also confirmed that all five Japenese nationals are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding that the vehicle carrying the Japanese nationals was bullet-proof, the DIG added that no one has claimed responsibility of the attack so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Japanese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate statements, they praised police for quickly responding and averting casualties by foiling the terrorist attack. The leaders also resolved to eliminate terrorism and prayed for speedy recovery of those injured in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The whole nation will unitedly fight out the terrorism. The miscreants will be rooted out from the country,&amp;rdquo;Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the Pakistan president as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
